# Overview

This project was to program the game Zilch, a dice game where you roll a pool of 6 dice scoring based on various possible combinations. Players take turn rolling until they choose to end their turn or they roll a pool with no possible scoring options. This was my first entry into Kotlin as a language so I wanted something that would let me learn a variety of techniques.
